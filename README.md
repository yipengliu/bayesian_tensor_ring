# demo for Beyesian tensor ring

The codes are for the paper:

Zhen Long, Ce Zhu, Jiani Liu, Yipeng Liu, "Bayesian Low Rank Tensor Ring for Image Recovery,"  IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2021. DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2021.3062195.

For experiments on color image completion: 
demo_image_recovery.m 

For setting up, we can add path by the following sentence:
addpath('mylib');  addpath('TestImage');
